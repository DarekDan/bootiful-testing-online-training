This is the rough outline for my "Bootiful Testing" talk, first presented here [https://learning.oreilly.com/live-training/courses/bootiful-testing/0636920239550/] in this longer format. 

* the test pyramid
* test-driven development

* unit testing with JUnit, AssertJ, Hamcrest 
* testing the data tier with our first test slice 
* testing the repository custom finder method 
* testing reactive code w/ `StepVerifier`
* testing the web tier with webflux test slice 
* `@MockBean`, Mockito and stubbing as a practice
* selenium for a UI? 
* introduce security and test that? 
* intro a client 
* test that the client works using wiremock 
* consumer driven contract and consumer driven contract testing 
* rabbitmq or kafka queues
