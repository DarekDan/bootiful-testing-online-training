# Bootiful Testing 

This is the rough outline for my "Bootiful Testing" talk, first presented [here](https://learning.oreilly.com/live-training/courses/bootiful-testing/0636920239550/) in this longer format. 

Arguably, most of these examples should be done in terms of non-reactive code. We should introduce JPA and Servlet-testing as well as reactive testing. 



* the test pyramid
* test-driven development 
* inside-out vs. outside-in testing 
* generate new projects on the Initializr (notice that all the testing support is included)
* unit testing with JUnit, AssertJ, Hamcrest 
* testing the data tier with our first test slice 
* testing the repository custom finder method 
* testing the web tier with webflux test slice 
* testing the web tier with web test slice
* spring rest docs 
* `@MockBean`, Mockito and stubbing as a practice
* selenium for a UI? 
* introduce security into an app and test that? 
* intro a client 
* test that the client works using wiremock 
* consumer driven contract and consumer driven contract testing 
* rabbitmq or kafka queues 
* continuous delivery
* testing reactive code w/ `StepVerifier` 
* setting up a project to do integration testing; using the CF Java Client 
* JUnit 5
